              its own so we can be able to edit it particularly -->
          <!-- We didnt type the <i class="bi bi-search"></i>. it was copied from 
                bootstrap icon as the link for putting SEARCH ICON. Bootstrap already did
                the work. In case I want to type for putting icon mannually by typing it,
                the i is a tag for putting icons. just type i and enter. its diffrent 
              from the i of italics symbol. -->
